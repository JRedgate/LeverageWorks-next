              Alberta energy services companies operate in one of the most data-rich environments in the world. Field crews, equipment, dispatch, compliance, procurement, and project cost data are all being captured somewhere. The problem is that somewhere is five different systems, three spreadsheets, and a set of paper tickets sitting in a truck.

              By the time that data reaches the people who need to make decisions with it, the day is already over. LVRGWRKS builds the integration and automation layer that connects your field and back-office operations so decisions get made on current information, not yesterday's.

              <span className="text-brand-gold font-bold tracking-widest text-[11px] uppercase mb-4 block">The Problem</span>
              <h2 className="font-display font-bold text-4xl text-brand-navy mb-6">Where energy services companies lose margin they cannot afford to lose</h2>
              <p className="text-brand-slate text-lg leading-relaxed max-w-3xl mb-6">
                Commodity price cycles compress margins. Labour availability limits capacity. Regulatory requirements add compliance overhead. In this environment, every avoidable cost matters -- and most avoidable costs in energy services companies trace back to the same root cause: operational data that does not flow where it needs to go.
              </p>
              <p className="text-brand-slate text-lg leading-relaxed max-w-3xl">
                When dispatch happens over phone and text, when field tickets get reconciled manually against the job cost system, when equipment utilization lives in a spreadsheet no one has time to maintain, the coordination overhead compounds. Your best people spend their time managing information instead of managing operations.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-8">

                <p className="text-brand-slate text-sm leading-relaxed">
                  Field data lives in paper tickets, tablets, and field management apps that do not connect to your ERP or accounting system. The back office makes billing, payroll, and cost decisions on information that arrived hours or days late, if it arrived at all. The gap between what happened in the field and what your systems know about it is where margin disappears.
                </p>

                <p className="text-brand-slate text-sm leading-relaxed">
                  Crew scheduling and dispatch managed over phone and text does not scale and does not leave a record. When a re-dispatch is needed due to equipment issues, weather, or client changes, the coordination happens in real time across multiple conversations with no system capturing what changed, why, or what it cost.
                </p>

              <div className="bg-brand-surface p-8 rounded-xl border border-gray-100">

                <p className="text-brand-slate text-sm leading-relaxed">
                  Safety documentation, equipment certifications, regulatory submissions, and client compliance requirements generate significant administrative overhead. When that documentation is managed manually, it creates risk of gaps and consumes administrative capacity that should be doing something else.
