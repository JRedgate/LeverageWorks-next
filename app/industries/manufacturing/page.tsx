            <p className="text-brand-slate text-xl leading-relaxed max-w-2xl mb-6">
              Manufacturing companies generate more operational data than almost any other industry. Production output, quality results, equipment status, labour hours, material consumption, and supplier lead times -- all being captured somewhere. The problem is that somewhere is usually a collection of disconnected systems, manual logs, and spreadsheets that require human effort to reconcile.
            </p>
            <p className="text-brand-slate text-xl leading-relaxed max-w-2xl mb-10">
              When your production team is spending time on reporting instead of production, and your leadership is making decisions on last week's numbers, the operational drag compounds. LVRGWRKS builds the integration and automation layer that connects your manufacturing systems and eliminates the manual work in between.

              <h2 className="font-display font-bold text-4xl text-brand-navy mb-6">Where manufacturing companies lose capacity they cannot get back</h2>
              <p className="text-brand-slate text-lg leading-relaxed max-w-3xl mb-6">
                The most common pattern we see in mid-market manufacturing is this: the production floor is running, the quality system is capturing data, the ERP is tracking inventory and orders -- and none of them are talking to each other in real time. The integration layer between systems is a person. Usually several people.
              </p>
              <p className="text-brand-slate text-lg leading-relaxed max-w-3xl">
                When you add headcount to growing operations but the processes stay manual, you scale complexity rather than capacity. Revenue grows. Headcount grows faster. Margin compresses. The answer is not more people to manage the coordination. It is systems that eliminate the coordination overhead entirely.
              </p>

                <h3 className="font-display font-bold text-lg text-brand-navy mb-4">Production data that arrives too late to act on</h3>
                <p className="text-brand-slate text-sm leading-relaxed">
                  When production output, downtime events, and quality results have to be manually entered into the ERP, the data arrives hours after the events occurred. Supervisors make shift decisions on yesterday's numbers. Planners schedule tomorrow's production on incomplete information. The lag between what is happening on the floor and what the system knows about it has real operational costs.
                </p>

              <div className="bg-brand-surface p-8 rounded-xl border border-gray-100">

                <p className="text-brand-slate text-sm leading-relaxed">
                  Quality results live in the quality management system. Production data lives in the MES or ERP. When these systems do not share data automatically, correlating quality issues with production conditions requires manual analysis that takes time and expertise. By the time the root cause is understood, the condition has repeated itself.
                </p>

                <p className="text-brand-slate text-sm leading-relaxed">
                  Shift reports, daily production summaries, quality scorecards, and KPI dashboards are assembled manually from multiple data sources. The people doing the assembling -- supervisors, production managers, quality leads -- are the same people whose job is to run the operation. Every hour spent on reporting is an hour not spent managing.

              LVRGWRKS builds custom automation and integration systems for manufacturing companies across Alberta and Western Canada. We connect your existing tools -- your ERP, your MES or production management system, your quality system, your maintenance management platform -- into a unified operating layer. No rip-and-replace. We build around what you have and eliminate the manual work between systems.

                  Production output, material consumption, labour hours, and downtime events flow automatically from the production floor into your ERP and planning systems. No manual entry at shift end. Your inventory, costing, and scheduling data reflects what is actually happening in real time, not what someone recorded this morning.

                  Quality results automatically correlated with production conditions -- shift, line, operator, material lot, equipment settings. When a quality issue emerges, the relevant production context is already attached. Root cause analysis that used to take days takes hours. Corrections happen before the condition repeats.

                <p className="text-brand-slate text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                  Labour availability, input cost volatility, and the demands of customers in resource-intensive industries mean Alberta manufacturers operate with tighter margins and less tolerance for operational waste than manufacturers in other markets. Getting more out of your current capacity is not a nice-to-have. It is a competitive requirement.

                <p className="text-brand-slate text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                  LVRGWRKS was founded in Calgary and works with manufacturing companies across Alberta and Western Canada. We understand the operational constraints of this market -- the labour pressure, the input cost exposure, the customer requirements -- because it is the context our clients navigate every day.

                <p className="text-brand-slate text-lg leading-relaxed">
                  We work with discrete manufacturers, process manufacturers, and industrial fabricators ranging from 20 to 250 employees. If your team is running hard but the operation is not performing at the level the business needs, that gap is where we work.
