              Construction is a margin-thin, schedule-critical business. The difference between a profitable project and an overrun is often the quality of information reaching your team -- and how quickly it gets there. When your PMs are spending hours each week pulling data from disconnected systems, they are not managing the job. They are managing the reporting.

      <section className="py-20 md:py-32 bg-white">
        <div className="container mx-auto px-6 md:px-16">
          <div className="max-w-5xl mx-auto">
            <div className="mb-16">
              <span className="text-brand-gold font-bold tracking-widest text-[11px] uppercase mb-4 block">The Problem</span>
              <h2 className="font-display font-bold text-4xl text-brand-navy mb-6">Where construction companies lose margin they do not have to lose</h2>
              <p className="text-brand-slate text-lg leading-relaxed max-w-3xl mb-6">
                Most construction companies in Alberta are running their projects on a combination of project management software, accounting software, spreadsheets, and email chains that do not talk to each other. The field team captures data in one place. Finance lives somewhere else. Subcontractor communications happen in a third system. And your PM is manually bridging all of it.
              </p>
              <p className="text-brand-slate text-lg leading-relaxed max-w-3xl">
                The cost of that manual bridging is not just labour hours. It is decision latency. By the time a cost overrun surfaces through the manual reporting cycle, the window to correct it has often closed. The damage is already done.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-8">

                <h3 className="font-display font-bold text-lg text-brand-navy mb-4">Cost overruns discovered too late</h3>
                <p className="text-brand-slate text-sm leading-relaxed">
                  When job cost data lives in disconnected systems, overruns appear at month-end reporting rather than when they can still be managed. The job is over before the numbers tell the story. Real-time cost tracking against estimate changes this completely -- your PMs know where they stand on every active project, every day.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div className="bg-brand-surface p-8 rounded-xl border border-gray-100">

                <p className="text-brand-slate text-sm leading-relaxed">
                  Scheduling, dispatch, compliance documentation, and communication with subcontractors happens across phone calls, texts, and email. At small project volumes this is manageable. As you scale, it becomes a full-time coordination job that produces no value -- just status updates that should be automatic.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div className="bg-brand-surface p-8 rounded-xl border border-gray-100">
                <h3 className="font-display font-bold text-lg text-brand-navy mb-4">Reporting that consumes PM time</h3>
                <p className="text-brand-slate text-sm leading-relaxed">
                  Project managers are the most expensive operational resource in a construction company. When they spend a significant portion of their week assembling progress reports, compiling cost summaries, and chasing status updates, the cost is not just the hours. It is the job-site attention that is not happening while they are at their desk.
