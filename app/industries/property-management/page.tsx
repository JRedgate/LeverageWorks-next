              Property management is fundamentally a coordination business. Tenants, owners, maintenance vendors, inspectors, leasing agents, and accountants all generating requests, documentation, and data that needs to flow between disconnected systems. At small portfolio sizes this is manageable. As you add doors, the coordination overhead compounds faster than the revenue does.

              LVRGWRKS builds the automation layer that connects your property management platform, accounting system, maintenance workflows, and communication tools so the coordination happens automatically and your team focuses on the work that actually requires human judgment.

              <span className="text-brand-gold font-bold tracking-widest text-[11px] uppercase mb-4 block">The Problem</span>
              <h2 className="font-display font-bold text-4xl text-brand-navy mb-6">Why property management companies hire when they should be automating</h2>
              <p className="text-brand-slate text-lg leading-relaxed max-w-3xl mb-6">
                The most common growth trap in property management is hiring administrative staff to manage coordination overhead that should not exist. Maintenance request routing that happens manually over email. Owner reports assembled by hand from three different data sources. Lease renewals tracked in a spreadsheet. Billing reconciled between the property management platform and the accounting system by someone at a keyboard.
              </p>
              <p className="text-brand-slate text-lg leading-relaxed max-w-3xl">
                Each of those workflows feels manageable at 200 units. At 500 units it requires dedicated staff. At 1,000 units it requires a team. The work is not generating value. It is managing coordination that well-built systems would handle automatically. LVRGWRKS has helped property management companies recover significant weekly labour hours and eliminate the need for planned administrative hires by connecting the systems that should already be talking to each other.

                <h3 className="font-display font-bold text-lg text-brand-navy mb-4">Maintenance workflows managed over email and phone</h3>
                <p className="text-brand-slate text-sm leading-relaxed">
                  Maintenance requests arrive through multiple channels, get triaged manually, assigned to vendors over phone or email, and tracked through follow-up calls. When the job is done, the information has to be manually entered into the property management platform. Each request that should require minimal human involvement requires multiple touchpoints, every time.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div className="bg-brand-surface p-8 rounded-xl border border-gray-100">
                <h3 className="font-display font-bold text-lg text-brand-navy mb-4">Owner reports assembled manually every month</h3>
                <p className="text-brand-slate text-sm leading-relaxed">
                  Owner reporting requires pulling data from your property management platform, your accounting system, and your maintenance records, then formatting it into a report that looks professional and tells a coherent story. Multiply that by the number of owners you report to and you have a significant monthly administrative burden that produces no incremental value -- just information transfer that should be automatic.
                </p>

                <p className="text-brand-slate text-sm leading-relaxed">
                  When your property management platform and your accounting system do not sync automatically, someone reconciles them manually. Rent rolls, maintenance charges, late fees, and owner distributions all have to be verified against two sources of truth. The error risk is real, and the time cost compounds with every unit added to the portfolio.
