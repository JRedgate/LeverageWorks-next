              LVRGWRKS was founded in Calgary by someone who spent 20 years watching smart, growing businesses get strangled by the same problem. Revenue grows, headcount grows faster, and the coordination tax quietly eats the margin that growth was supposed to deliver. We built LVRGWRKS to fix it.

                <p className="text-brand-slate leading-relaxed mb-6">
                  LVRGWRKS was founded on 20 years of hands-on operational experience across manufacturing, industrial services, and capital programs. Not a software startup. Not a management consultancy. Real operations, in real industries, with real margin pressure and real consequences when the math stops working.
                </p>
                <p className="text-brand-slate leading-relaxed mb-6">
                  That experience taught us one thing above everything else: most technology transformations fail not because the technology is wrong, but because the operating model around the technology is wrong. You can buy the best software on the market and still end up with your team manually moving data between systems at 9pm on a Tuesday. The tools exist. The talent exists. What's missing is the layer that connects what leadership wants to what the operation can actually execute.
                </p>
                <p className="text-brand-slate leading-relaxed">
                  That missing layer is what LVRGWRKS builds.

                  Architected during an EMBA. Sharpened in the field.

                <p className="text-brand-slate leading-relaxed mb-6">
                  LVRGWRKS was architected during the Haskayne School of Business EMBA at the University of Calgary, grounded in the executive and financial frameworks the program is known for. EBITDA discipline, capital efficiency, structural thinking about how businesses actually create value.
                </p>
                <p className="text-brand-slate leading-relaxed mb-6">
                  The Haskayne training matters because it's where the operational experience and the financial rigor come together. A Leverage Audit isn't a process-improvement exercise. It's a structural diagnosis of where your business is losing capacity and what that capacity is worth in P&L terms. Every recommendation we make ties back to one question: does this move the numbers, or doesn't it?

                  If it doesn't move the numbers, we don't build it.

                Most consultants make your existing system faster. We ask a different question first: is the structure itself economically viable under growth? If it's not, speeding it up just gets you to the cliff faster. We fix the structure, then we make it fast.

                AI augments human decision-making. It does not replace it. Our implementations keep your leadership team accountable for the decisions that matter and remove the friction from the decisions that shouldn't require a human at all.

              The Alberta mid-market operates differently. <span className="text-brand-slate italic">We built LVRGWRKS for that.</span>
            </h2>
            <p className="text-brand-slate text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Most AI and automation firms were built inside the tech ecosystem. They know SaaS, they know software, and they know how to sell enterprise dashboards. They don't know what it feels like to run a 40-truck energy services company at 6am, or coordinate six subcontractors across a multi-site construction project, or reconcile maintenance requests across a growing property management portfolio. They don't know the operations. They know the tools.
            </p>
            <p className="text-brand-slate text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              LVRGWRKS is built the other way around. Operations first, tools second. We work with founders, owners, and COOs of mid-market companies (20 to 250 employees, $5M to $150M in revenue) across Alberta and Western Canada, because that's where the operational realities and the operational opportunities are the clearest. When you engage LVRGWRKS, you're not hiring a vendor who's going to learn your industry on your dime. You're adding a partner who already speaks the language.
            </p>
            <p className="text-brand-slate text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Every workflow, automation, and AI agent we build belongs to you from day one. No vendor lock-in. No dependency on us. The engagement can end at any time and your operation keeps running. That's not a risk reversal tactic. It's the only honest way to build what we build.
